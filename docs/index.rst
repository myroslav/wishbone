**A Python framework to build event pipeline servers with minimal effort.**

Bootstrap a  server
===================

Wishbone `servers`_ are started with bootstrap file:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ wishbone start --config eventprocessor.yaml


`Bootstrap files`_ define the modules_ to initialize and how these should be
connected to each other:

    :align: right

.. literalinclude:: examples/test_setup.yaml
   :language: yaml


Running a server:

.. code-block:: sh

    [smetj@dev-container ~]$ wishbone debug --config simple.yaml
