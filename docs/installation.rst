Modules are stored into a hierarchic name space.  The complete name of a
module consists out of the group name + the module name.  You can read the details of a module by executing the *show* command:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ wishbone show wishbone.builtin.input.testevent
    **Generates a test event at the chosen interval.**

        This module is only available for testing purposes and has further hardly any use.

        Events have following format:

            { "header":{}, "data":"test" }

        Parameters:

            - name (str):               The instance name when initiated.

            - interval (float):         The interval in seconds between each generated event.
                                        Should have a value > 0.
                                        default: 1

        Queues:

            - outbox:    Contains the generated events.


External modules
''''''''''''''''

Not all modules are builtin modules.  There is a collection of modules which
can be downloaded from https://github.com/smetj/wishboneModules.  The reason
they are not builtin modules is to limit the number of dependencies for
Wishbone itself.  All modules are also in 1 repository.  Within time they will
be available as separate projects and added to Pypi.

To install an *external* module follow these steps:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/smetj/wishboneModules.git
    $ cd wb_output_tcp
    $ python setup.py install
    $ wishbone show wishbone.output.tcp
    **A Wishbone IO module which writes data to a TCP socket.**

    Writes data to a tcp socket.

    Parameters:

        - name (str):       The instance name when initiated.

        - host (string):    The host to submit to.
                            Default: "localhost"

        - port (int):       The port to submit to.
                            Default: 19283

        - timeout(int):     The time in seconds to timeout when
                            connecting
                            Default: 1

        - delimiter(str):   A delimiter to add to each event.
                            Default: "\n"

        - success (bool):   When True, submits succesfully outgoing
                            events to the 'success' queue.
                            Default: False

        - failed (bool):    When True, submits failed outgoing
                            events to the 'failed' queue.
                            Default: False

    Queues:

        - inbox:    Incoming events submitted to the outside.

        - success:  Contains events which went out succesfully.
                    (optional)

        - failed:   Contains events which did not go out successfully.
                    (optional)
