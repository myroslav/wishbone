What is Wishbone?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wishbone is a Python application framework to build and CLI tool to manage
async event pipeline servers with minimal effort.  The functionality of a
Wishbone server is determined by the choice of initialized modules and the way
they have been connected to each other which determines the event flow.

Each Wishbone module fulfills exactly and preferably only one function.  A
minimal Wishbone setup consists out of an input and an output module which are
connected to each other.  Usually more modules are sitting between the input
and output module.

A Wishbone setup can be described using a bootstrap file.  The bootstrap file
is used to initialize the setup and let the server run as a permanent solution.

Why have you written this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The need to write Wishbone has its roots in my operations background and role.
I often have to deploy solutions which accept data from some source, do
something with it, submit that modified data again to another destination.
Running solutions change or have to be reinitialized using different
properties.  New functionality needs to be injected in existing setups.
