===================
Bootstraping on CLI
===================

Wishbone comes with a CLI tool to easily bootstrap a server using a YAML
formatted config file.  Following file creates exactly the same environment as
the above example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test_setup.yaml
   :language: yaml

Bootstrapping the environment is just a matter of invoking the **wishbone**
executable with the --config parameter pointing to the bootstrap file.


Available commands
==================

start
-----

The start command detaches the Wishbone server from console and runs it in the
background.  This implies that logs are written to syslog unless specifically
defined otherwise.  Metrics are written to Null unless specifically defined
otherwise.

The pidfile contains the pids of the control process and all child processes.
When stopping a Wishbone instance make sure you point to the pid file used to
start the Wishbone instance.


.. code-block:: sh

    [smetj@indigo ~]$ wishbone start -h
    usage: wishbone start [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--instances INSTANCES]
                          [--pid PID]

    Starts a Wishbone instance and detaches to the background. Logs are written to
    syslog.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --config CONFIG       The Wishbone bootstrap file to load.
      --instances INSTANCES
                            The number of parallel Wishbone instances to
                            bootstrap.
      --pid PID             The pidfile to use.


------------------

debug
-----

The debug command does pretty much the same as start just that it keeps the
Wishbone instance in the foreground without detaching it.  Logs are written to
STDOUT.  The running instance can be stopped gracefully with CTRL+C

.. code-block:: sh

    [smetj@indigo ~]$ wishbone debug -h
    usage: wishbone debug [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--instances INSTANCES]

    Starts a Wishbone instance in foreground and writes logs to STDOUT.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --config CONFIG       The Wishbone bootstrap file to load.
      --instances INSTANCES
                            The number of parallel Wishbone instances to
                            bootstrap.


------------------

stop
----

Stops the Wishbone instance gracefully by sending SIGINT to all processes.

.. code-block:: sh

    smetj@indigo ~]$ wishbone stop -h
    usage: wishbone stop [-h] [--pid PID]

    Tries to gracefully stop the Wishbone instance.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      --pid PID   The pidfile to use.


------------------

kill
----

** Use with caution, sends SIGKILL to the pids in the pidfile. **

.. code-block:: sh

    [smetj@indigo ~]$ wishbone kill -h
    usage: wishbone kill [-h] [--pid PID]

    Kills the Wishbone processes immediately.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      --pid PID   The pidfile to use.


------------------

list
----

Lists all installed Wishbone modules, given that they have the correct entry-points.

.. code-block:: sh

    [smetj@indigo ~]$ wishbone list

.. code-block:: sh

    [smetj@indigo ~]$ wishbone show wishbone.builtin.flow.fanout
    **A builtin Wishbone module which duplicates incoming events to all
        connected queues.**

        Create a "1 to n" relationship with queues.  Events arriving in inbox
        are then copied to each queue connected to this module.  Keep in mind
        that the outbox queue is never used.

        When clone is True, each incoming event is duplicated for each outgoing
        queue.  This might be usefull if you require to change the content of the
        events later down the pipeline.  Otherwise references are used which means
        changing the event will change it everywhere in the current Wishbone
        framework.


        Parameters:

            name(str):      The name of the module.

            clone(bool):    When True actually makes a copy instead of passing
                            a reference.

        Queues:

            inbox:  Incoming events
