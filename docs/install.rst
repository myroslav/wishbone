Basic Installation
==================

Wishbone should be installed into the same site-packages area where the
application and extensions are installed (either a virtualenv or the
global site-packages). You may need administrative privileges to do
that.  

Wishbone is build upon the latest features available in gevent (http://www.gevent.org).
So installing Wishbone consists out of 2 steps:

* Download and install a recent gevent.
* Download and install Wishbone.

   $ tar -xvzf 1.0b2.tar.gz
   $ cd [into_directory]
   $ sudo python setup.py install
