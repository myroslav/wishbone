Components
==========

A Wishbone service consists out of a combination of different components.
Wishbone has 3 component types:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    modules/index
    functions/index
    protocols/index


Components are referred to with a unique name written in dotted format:


.. code-block:: text

    <namespace>.<component type>.<category>.<name>


``namespace`` is a logical grouping for components.  The ``wishbone``
namespace indicates the component is an one part of the default Wishbone
installation or the Wishbone project.  If you develop additional components
outside of the Wishbone project itself, it is advised to do so in its
dedicated namespace.

``component type``, ``category`` and ``name`` further categorize the the components into logical groupings.

Each component has an `entrypoint`_ so it can be referred to from a bootstrap
file. The default Wishbone entrypoints are defined in its setup.py file. A
component entrypoint is the same as the component name.

An overview of available components can be viewed by using the ``list`` command:


.. code-block:: text

    $ wishbone list
              __       __    __
    .--.--.--|__.-----|  |--|  |--.-----.-----.-----.
    |  |  |  |  |__ --|     |  _  |  _  |     |  -__|
    |________|__|_____|__|__|_____|_____|__|__|_____|
                                       version 3.0.0

    Build composable event pipeline servers with minimal effort.
