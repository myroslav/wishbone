How?
----

The WishBone Python library offers a framework to write asynchronous event
pipeline servers with minimal effort.  In this context, event pipelines are
best described as a collection of concurrently running modules which consume,
process and produce events. Wishbone module queues are connected to one
another forming a pipeline through which these events travel.  Wishbone
servers can be configured and controlled from from command line using
bootstrap files. Bootstrap files allow to cherry-pick Wishbone modules and to
define how events travel through them.  Multiple identical Wishbone instances
can run as separate processes offering parallel execution.
