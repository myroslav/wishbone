WishBone
========

What?
-----
A Python library to easily write coroutine based event pipeline solutions.

How?
----

In this context, "event pipelines" would be best described as a collection of isolated functions connected into a workflow through which events travel and change.
This is done by shoveling events from one module's queue into the other in order to create a "flow-chart like" event pipeline. A Wishbone module follows the Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing and do it well. Within a Wishbone instance, the modules are running pseudo-concurrently using greenlets on top of a libevent event loop thanks to the the great Gevent library.  Wishbone also offers the possibility to start multiple concurrent processes each with a Wishbone (libevent) instance.
