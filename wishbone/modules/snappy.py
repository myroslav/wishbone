from wishbone.toolkit import PrimitiveActor

class Snappy(PrimitiveActor):
    '''**A Wishbone module which compresses or decompresses data using Snappy.**

    This module can be initiated in 2 modes:
        - compress
        - decompress

    When initiated in "compress" mode it will compress all incoming data.  When
    initiated in "decompress" mode, it will try to decompress all incoming data.

    When purges is set to True, incoming events will be dropped when decompression
    fails, otherwise it will be forwarded in its original state.
    
    Watch out, compression is cpu bound, which could impact your event loop.

    Parameters:

        - name (str):       The instance name when initiated.
        - mode (str):       "compress" or "decompress"
        - purge (bool):     When true then the event will be purged if decompression fails.
        
    Queues:

        - inbox:    Incoming events.
        - outbox:   Outgoing events.
