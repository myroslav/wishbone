    '''A Wisbone module which handles AMQP0.8 input and output.  It's meant to be resillient to disconnects and broker unavailability.
    
    Data consumed from the broker goes into self.inbox
    Data which should be produced towards to broker goes into self.outbox
    
    The message submitted to self.outbox should have 2 values in its headers:
    
        {'header':{'broker_exchange':name, 'broker_key':name}}
        
        broker_exchange:    The exchange to which data should be submitted.
        broker_key:         The routing key used when submitting data.
    
    Parameters:
        name:               The name you want this module to be registered under.
        host:               The name or IP of the broker.
        vhost:              The virtual host of the broker. By default this is '/'
        username:           The username to connect to the broker.  By default this is 'guest'.
        password:           The password to connect to the broker.  By default this is 'guest'.
        consume_queue:      The queue which should be consumed. By default this is "wishbone_in".
