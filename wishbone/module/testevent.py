class TestEvent(Actor):

    '''**Generates a test event at the chosen interval.**


    Events have following format:

        { "header":{}, "data":"test" }

    Parameters:

        - name (str):           The instance name when initiated.

        - size (int):           The size of all module queues.

        - interval (float):     The interval in seconds between each generated event.
                                A value of 0 means as fast as possible.
                                default: 1

        - message (string):     The content of the test message.
                                default: "test"

        - numbered (bool):      When true, appends a sequential number to the end.
                                default: False

    Queues:

        - outbox:    Contains the generated events.
