class TestEvent(Actor):

    '''**Generates a test event at the chosen interval.**

    The data field of the test event contains the string "test".


    Parameters:

        - name(str)
           |  The name of the module.

        - size(int)
           |  The default max length of each queue.

        - frequency(int)
           |  The frequency in seconds to generate metrics.

        - interval(float)(1)
           |  The interval in seconds between each generated event.
           |  A value of 0 means as fast as possible.

        - message(string)("test")
           |  The content of the test message.

        - numbered(bool)
           |  When true, appends a sequential number to the end.


    Queues:

        - outbox
           |  Contains the generated events.
