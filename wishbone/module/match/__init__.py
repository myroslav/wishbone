class Match(Actor):

    '''**Pattern matching on a key/value document stream.**

    This module routes messages to queue based upon the matching rule.
    Multiple matching rules are possible.

    Rules on disk are in YAML format and consist out of 2 parts:

        - condition:

        The condition part contains the individual conditions which have to
        match for the complete rule to match.

        re:     Regex matching
        !re:    Negative regex matching
        >:      Bigger than
        >=:     Bigger or equal than
        <:      Smaller than
        <=:     Smaller or equal than
        =:      Equal than
        in:     Evaluate list membership

        - queue:

        The queue section contains a list of dictionaries/maps each containing
        1 key with another dictionary/map as a value.  These key/value pairs
        are added to the *header section* of the event and stored under the
        queue name key.
        If you are not interested in adding any information to the header you
        can leave the dictionary empty.  So this would be valid:

        ::

            condition:
                "greeting": re:^hello$
            queue:
                - outbox:


        This example would route events wich have the field "greeting" containing
        the value "hello" to the outbox queue without adding any information
        to the header of the event itself.

    Example
    ~~~~~~~

    ::

        condition:
            "check_command": re:check:host.alive
            "hostproblemid": re:\d*
            "hostgroupnames": in:tag:development

        queue:
            - email:
                from: monitoring@yourdomain.com
                to:
                    - oncall@yourdomain.com
                subject: UMI - Host  {{ hostname }} is  {{ hoststate }}.
                template: host_email_alert




    When connecting modules to non-existing queues, they will be automatically
    created.  When a document machtes and is submitted to a queue which does
    not exist then the messages will be discarded.


    Parameters:

        - name(str)
           |  The name of the module.

        - size(int)
           |  The default max length of each queue.

        - frequency(int)
           |  The frequency in seconds to generate metrics.

        - location(str)(None)
           |  The directory containing rules.
           |  If none, no rules are read from disk.

        - rules(list)({})
           |  A list of rules in the above described format.


    Queues:

        - inbox
           |  Incoming events

        - <queue_name>
           |  The queue which matches a rule.
