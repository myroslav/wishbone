    Parameters:

        - name(str)
           |  The name of the module.

        - size(int)
           |  The default max length of each queue.

        - frequency(int)
           |  The frequency in seconds to generate metrics.

        - directory(str)
           |  The directory to write data to.

        - idle_trigger(bool)(False)
           |  When True, only reads events when no new events
           |  have been written to disk for at least <idle_time>.


        - idle_time(int)(10)
           |  The time in seconds required that no new events
           |  have been written to disk prior to start to consume
           |  the buffered data.


    Queues:

        - outbox
           |  Incoming events.
