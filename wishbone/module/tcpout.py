    '''**A TCP client which writes data to a TCP socket.**

    Writes data to a tcp socket.

    When <data> is of type list, all elements
    will be joined using <delimiter> and submitted together.

    Parameters:

        - host(string)("localhost")
           |  The host to submit to.

        - port(int)(19283)
           |  The port to submit to.

        - timeout(int)(1)
           |  The time in seconds to timeout when connecting

        - delimiter(str)("\\n")
           |  A delimiter to add to each event.


    Queues:

        - inbox
           |  Incoming events submitted to the outside.
