class RoundRobin(Actor):

    '''**A builtin Wishbone module which round robins incoming events
    over all connected queues.**

    Create a "1 to n" relationship between queues.  Events arriving in inbox
    are then submitted in a roundrobin (or randomized) fashion to the
    connected queues.  The outbox queue is non existent.


    Parameters:

        name(str):      The name of the module.

        randomize(bool):    Randomizes the queue selection instead of going
                            round robin over all queues.

    Queues:

        inbox:  Incoming events
