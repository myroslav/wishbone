class RoundRobin(Actor):

    '''**Round-robins incoming events to all connected queues.**

    Create a "1 to n" relationship between queues.  Events arriving in inbox
    are then submitted in a roundrobin (or randomized) fashion to the
    connected queues.  The outbox queue is non existent.

    Parameters:

        -   name(str)
            The name of the module.

        -   size(int)
            The default max length of each queue.

        -   frequency(int)
            The frequency in seconds to generate metrics.

        -   randomize(bool):

            Randomizes the queue selection instead of going round robin over
            all queues.

    Queues:
